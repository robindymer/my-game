Game story:

You wake up in a bright white room. You are dizzy and blended 
but you feel better after a while. You don't remember anything
and you a trapped in a chair. Now you need to escape, find out
what's happening and get memory fragments to remember your
story. You will need to go through rooms, fight bosses,
collect memory fragments and when you have all of the memory
fragments, you are ready for the final mission. You will also
find notes on the way that will tell you things about what's
happening.
You are going to have a name, health bar, weapons, abilitys.
The user is going to be able to get help for knowing that the
options are, the abilitys he have and the things he can do.
Try to find good modules for intresting stuff, maybe open gif's
for different scenes.
There will be different rooms and each room is going to have an
own class. You are going to run the game through an engine.
The person can enter a room only once but he can choose to enter
the rooms in any order he wants to.
From LPTHW: Your runner will need to know about these rooms, 
so make a class that runs them and knows about them. There's 
plenty of ways to do this, but consider having each room return 
what room is next or setting a variable of what room is next.
Plot: Stealing intellectual abilitys, the manager is your father. 
They did this to create a highly intelligent person who could solver world problems.
That person is your sister. They needed to transfer it succesive.
